## Why

The goal was to design the look and experience, and create the HTML/CSS for adding products to an ecommerce store. 
On Digible users could store their products, and sell them on other platforms. 
One of the features was to make it easy to connect Digible with your e-commerce store.

So I set up to design a flow where some of the necessary steps and decisions could be set in a smooth manner, and the usage would be intuitive.

## How

* We set up the necessary decisions the user would need to make
* * At the same time trying to reduce the number of decision
* Then I started designing it in Graphiq (Vector design software)
